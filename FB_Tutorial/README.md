# Facebook Tutorial Project
This is a project made by following Facebook's React tutorial which can be found at:

https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple comments box that updates in realtime (similar to Disqus or Facebook itself).

Functionality includes:
- View all comments
- Submit a comment via a form
- Hooks for a custom backend
- Live updates (no page refresh required to see new comments)
- Markdown formatting

## Server
This project makes use of a local running server. This server is used purely for demonstration purposes, and is thus extremely basic - do not run a server like this in production! :)

The source code is provided by Facebook and is found in the "react-tutorial-master" folder. Instructions to run the server can be found at:
